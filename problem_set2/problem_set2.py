#  NAME
#    problem_set2_solutions.py
#
#  DESCRIPTION
#    Open, view, and analyze action potentials recorded during a behavioral
#    task.  In Problem Set 2, you will write create and test your own code to
#    create tuning curves.
#

#Helper code to import some functions we will use

def load_experiment(filename):
    """
    load_experiment takes the file name and reads in the data.  It returns a
    two-dimensional array, with the first column containing the direction of
    motion for the trial, and the second column giving you the time the
    animal began movement during thaht trial.

    load_neuraldata takes the file name and reads in the data for that neuron.
    It returns an arary of spike times.

def bin_spikes(trials, spk_times, time_bin):

    bin_spikes takes the trials array (with directions and times) and the spk_times
    array with spike times and returns the average firing rate for each of the
    eight directions of motion, as calculated within a time_bin before and after
    the trial time (time_bin should be given in seconds).  For example,
    time_bin = .1 will count the spikes from 100ms before to 100ms after the 
    trial began.
    
    dir_rates should be an 8x2 array with the first column containing the directions
    (in degrees from 0-360) and the second column containing the average firing rate
    for each direction

    This function takes the x-values and the y-values  in units of spikes/s 
    (found in the two columns of direction_rates) and plots a histogram and 
    polar representation of the tuning curve. It adds the given title.

def roll_axes(direction_rates):
    """
    roll_axes takes the x-values (directions) and y-values (direction_rates)
    and return new x and y values that have been "rolled" to put the maximum
    direction_rate in the center of the curve. The first and last y-value in the
    returned list should be set to be the same. (See problem set directions)
    Hint: Use np.roll()

    variance sigma.  It is scaled up to height A.

def fit_tuning_curve(centered_x,centered_y):
    """
    This takes our rolled curve, generates the guesses for the fit function,
    and runs the fit.  It returns the parameters to generate the curve.

def plot_fits(direction_rates,fit_curve,title):
    """
    This function takes the x-values and the y-values  in units of spikes/s 
    (found in the two columns of direction_rates and fit_curve) and plots the 
    actual values with circles, and the curves as lines in both linear and 
    polar plots.

    The function takes a 2-dimensional array with the x-values of the fit curve
    in the first column and the y-values of the fit curve in the second.  
    It returns the preferred direction of the neuron (in degrees).
