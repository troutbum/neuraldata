Problem Set 0: Submitting Assignments with Python: Instructions
===============================================================

We have prepared a video that should guide you through the required steps here. If you prefer, you can try on your own by following the steps below.

In this introductory problem set we’ll teach you how to retrieve, complete, and submit programming assignments.  There are three parts to the assignment:

1. Download the zip file containing the specific instructions and python code here. The contents of this file should be extracted to a folder called problem_set0 on your own computer.
2. You can then open the problem_set0.py file for editing.  It has instructions inside to show you how to complete this assignment.  We recommend using Spyder if you have never used Python before, but this is not mandatory – if you prefer another text editor or Python IDE that is fine but we will not be able to answer questions about other programming environments.
3. Submit the assignment by running problem_set0_submit.py which will upload your answer to Coursera.   This can be done from within Spyder.
Before you get started: If you have not already done so, ﻿please make sure to download and install Anaconda, a free Python distribution that has everything you need to complete the assignments for this course, including IPython Notebook and Spyder. You may use other Python environments instead of Spyder, but we will not be able to answer questions about other programming environments. Instructions for downloading Anaconda are available here.
