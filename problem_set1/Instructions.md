Problem Set 1: Spike Finder Code: Instructions
----------------------------------------------

Problem Set 1: Finding Spikes with Python
In this problem set, you will learn how to write functions in Python to explore and visualize real neural data.  Here's what you need to do:

1. Download the assignment zip file here and extract its contents on your own machine.  All of the necessary files should be unzipped into a folder called problem_set1.
2. Open the instructions, which are found in the pdf file called problem_set1.pdf .  This file contains detailed information about how to complete the assignment.
3. Submit your completed assigned, which will have two parts:
Upload the results of a python function you write (good_AP_finder), using the problem_set1_submit.py code
Upload images of figures you create using the Problem Set 1: Peer Assignment link
Have fun finding spikes!
